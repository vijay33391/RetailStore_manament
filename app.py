    ### Interact with the Database using Natural Language Queries

    Welcome to the **LLM Interaction** page, where you can interact with our database using natural language queries. The system leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to understand your questions and provide meaningful responses by querying the database or performing specific tasks.

    This feature allows you to:
    - **Ask questions** about the data stored in the database, such as retrieving specific records or aggregates.
    - **Request insights** based on your data, such as sales trends, predictions, and analysis.
    - **Receive personalized responses**, making it easier to understand complex data without needing to know SQL or programming languages.

    ### How It Works:
    - Simply type your **query** in the text box below (e.g., "Show me the sales data for January 2024" or "What were the top-selling products last month?").
    - The system will use a **powerful LLM** to translate your query into an appropriate database command or action.
    - Based on your request, you will either get **data** retrieved from the database or receive **insights** generated from machine learning models (e.g., sales predictions).

    ### Key Features:
    - **Natural Language Understanding**: The system is capable of interpreting complex questions in plain English (or any language the model supports).
    - **Database Querying**: Queries like "Show me the top 5 products with the highest sales" or "What was the average sales in Q1?" will be processed directly.
    - **Sales Prediction**: In addition to querying data, you can ask for predictions like "Predict the sales for next month".
    - **Customizable**: Over time, the system will get more accurate and tailored to your specific needs based on the interactions and feedback.

    ### Example Queries:
    - "What were the total sales for 2023?"
    - "Show me sales data for Product X in January."
    - "Can you predict next month's sales?"
    - "What are the average sales for each region?"

    ### Next Steps:
    Enter a question in the text box below and see how the system translates your natural language input into meaningful results.
